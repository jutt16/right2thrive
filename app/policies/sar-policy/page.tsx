            <p>
              This policy outlines the procedures and responsibilities for responding to
              Subject Access Requests (SARs) in accordance with the UK General Data Protection
              Regulation (UK GDPR), the EU GDPR, and the Data Protection Act 2018. It ensures
              that individuals can exercise their right to access personal data held about
              them by our organisation.
            </p>
            <p>
              As part of our commitment to the Right2Thrive initiative, we recognize the
              importance of ensuring that all individuals have access to their personal data.
              The Right2Thrive initiative emphasizes the fundamental right of individuals to
              thrive in a safe and supportive environment, which includes the protection and
              accessibility of personal information.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>
                <strong>Empower Individuals:</strong> By providing clear and straightforward
                access to personal data, we empower individuals to understand and manage their
                information.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ensure Transparency:</strong> We are committed to maintaining
                transparency in how personal data is collected, used, and shared, in accordance
                with the principles of the Right2Thrive initiative.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Support Well-being:</strong> Access to personal data is a key component
                of individual well-being, and our policy ensures that this access is granted in
                a timely and efficient manner.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We believe that integrating the principles of the Right2Thrive initiative into
              our Subject Access Request policy will enhance our commitment to protecting
              individual rights and promoting a culture of trust and respect.

              (data subject) to obtain confirmation of whether their personal data is being
              processed, access to that data, and supplementary information about the
              processing.

              from the data subject must be provided.

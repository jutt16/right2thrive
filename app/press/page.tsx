              <h3>A Legacy of Action</h3>
              <p>
                The Hub was founded by <strong>Colin Lee-Own</strong>, who has
                dedicated more than 30 years to community-led change in some of
                London‚Äôs hardest-hit neighbourhoods.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1994, he launched AD2000 Productions in Edmonton Green
                Shopping Centre, helping over 300 young people into education,
                training, and employment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Following the tragic 2019 murder of market trader Julio Gomes,
                Colin personally funded the transformation of a derelict
                building into the Right2Thrive Wellbeing Hub. (Source:{" "}

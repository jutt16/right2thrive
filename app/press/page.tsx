              <h3>A Legacy of Action</h3>
              <p>
                The Hub was founded by <strong>Colin Lee-Own</strong>, who has
                dedicated more than 30 years to community-led change in some of
                London’s hardest-hit neighbourhoods.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1994, he launched AD2000 Productions in Edmonton Green
                Shopping Centre, helping over 300 young people into education,
                training, and employment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Following the tragic 2019 murder of market trader Julio Gomes,
                Colin personally funded the transformation of a derelict
                building into the Right2Thrive Wellbeing Hub. (Source:{" "}

              </p>
              <p>
                This vision became a reality thanks to the crucial support of
                National Lottery Awards for All (The National Lottery Community
                Fund).

                “Persistent violence cannot be solved with enforcement alone.
                It must be tackled from the ground up — by healing trauma,
                creating opportunities, and restoring hope. Everyone has the
                right not just to survive, but to thrive.”

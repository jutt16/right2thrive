              <p>
                In a borough grappling with decades of persistent violence and a
                recent surge in crime, Right2Thrive UK has opened a transformative
                community space in Edmonton Green, Enfield. The nation‚Äôs first
                Wellbeing Hub adopts a bold public health approach to tackling
                violence and trauma by addressing their root causes through
                therapy, mentoring, and community healing.
              </p>

              <h3>The Need for Change in Enfield</h3>
              <p>
                Enfield continues to struggle with high levels of violent crime,
                leaving residents fearful and anxious about their safety. This
                year alone, incidents such as the murder of an 18-year-old on
                the A10 Great Cambridge Road on June 26th have shaken the local
                community. The young man was shot dead between Bush Hill Park
                and Southbury, prompting a police investigation but no arrests
                to date.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                ‚ÄúWe are living in fear and anxiety in Enfield due to the constant
                violence in our neighbourhood, and they expect us to live a normal
                life.‚Äù ‚Äî Sarah, Enfield Resident
              </blockquote>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Violent crimes in Enfield have risen by 18% this year, according
                  to the Metropolitan Police.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The borough has also seen over 430 knife crime incidents, many
                  involving young people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Domestic violence cases have surged by 12%, with 1,150 incidents
                  reported so far in 2025.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Born from Community-Led Consultations</h3>
              <p>
                The Right2Thrive UK Wellbeing Hub was conceived after extensive
                community-led consultations, where residents, experts, and
                activists shared their experiences and research.
              </p>
              <p>
                Among the key contributors was Dr. Ron Dodzo, who presented his
                groundbreaking research <em>The Life of a Top Boy</em>, which
                explores the realities of young people caught in cycles of violence
                and gang culture.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another pivotal voice was Vanessa Boachie, a BABCP-accredited
                Cognitive Behavioural Psychotherapist who specializes in culturally
                sensitive and trauma-informed approaches to therapy.
              </p>

              <h3>Made Possible by the Awards For All Community Fund</h3>
              <p>
                The creation of the Wellbeing Hub was made possible thanks to
                funding from the Awards For All Community Fund (The National Lottery
                Community Fund).
              </p>

              <h3>A Legacy of Action</h3>
              <p>
                The Hub‚Äôs founder, <strong>Colin Lee-Own</strong>, has spent over
                30 years championing community-led change in London‚Äôs most deprived

              <blockquote>
                ‚ÄúPersistent violence cannot be solved with enforcement alone. It
                must be tackled from the ground up ‚Äî by healing trauma, creating
                opportunities, and restoring hope. Everyone has the right not just
                to survive, but to thrive.‚Äù <br />‚Äî Colin Lee-Own
